Technologies used on this project include:
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript
4. React.js
5. Bulma
6. Git
7. Node.js

The following was left out of my implementation:
1. Testing: I could not complete the testing phase as I do not have the requisite experience to carry out testing.
2. Some CSS styling e.g Users button enlargment, show country button
3. Transition: when I move from the general/index page to the show individual users page, I did not finish implementing the changes on the Sho individual user page e.g User List header should show in an individual user page. When you click on male users, and it changes to that page, the header should show "Male users".
